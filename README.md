#Perl6 Native Compiler

Currently this is very basics and supports only basic variables.

Also type checking on variables with declared types (`my <type> $<name>`). This is because this does not supports Classes and Enums (whic are the only two types in the language).

After support for subroutines there will be support for enums. Than there will probably be support for classes.
